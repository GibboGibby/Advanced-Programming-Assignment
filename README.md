# Advanced Programming Assignment

Repo for my advanced programming assignment

The main solution is split into 3 projects

- Server
- Client

Where core is a static link library that includes the winsock (and opencv) header files, as well as information that would need to be shared between the two executable files

This includes the structs that will be sent between the client and server
As well as the enums
